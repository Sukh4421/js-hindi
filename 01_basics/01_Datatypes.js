/*
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. It also means that data types are automatically converted as-needed during script execution.

Seven data types that are primitives:

1. Boolean. true and false.
2. null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
3. undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
4. Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
5. BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
6. String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".
7 Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.






Non primitive Datatypes:
1. Arrays
2. Objects
3. Functions
